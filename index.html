        <h2>About Heather Malloy</h2>
        <p>I love building. Building something backed by user research and great UX design - even better. I am passionate, ask great questions, and genuinely want to make lives better - whether through a tool that we are creating together, or how we are working together to create that tool. I desire to work in a stimulating and challenging environment that lets me flex my existing skillset(s), while encouraging me to keep learning.</p>
